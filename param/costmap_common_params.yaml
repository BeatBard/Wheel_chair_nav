# Common Costmap Parameters (Shared between Global and Local Costmaps)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sensor Range Parameters
# ---------------------
# Maximum range at which to insert obstacles into the costmap
obstacle_range: 4.0
# Maximum range at which to ray-trace out obstacles from the map
raytrace_range: 4.5

# Robot Footprint Definition
# -----------------------
# The footprint is defined as a polygon with [x,y] coordinates
# Origin is at the robot's center (base_link frame)
# Coordinates are in meters:
# - X axis: positive forward, negative backward
# - Y axis: positive left, negative right
# Wheelchair dimensions: 85cm width Ã— 60cm length
footprint:
  - [-0.35, -0.425]  # Back-right corner
  - [-0.35,  0.425]  # Back-left corner
  - [ 0.35,  0.425]  # Front-left corner
  - [ 0.35, -0.425]  # Front-right corner

# Costmap Cell Properties
# ---------------------
# Radius around obstacles where cost is incurred (in meters)
inflation_radius: 0.15
# Factor to scale the exponential decay of inflation costs
# Lower values = higher cost near obstacles
cost_scaling_factor: 5.0

# Costmap Type Configuration
# ------------------------
# Type of map (voxel grid or costmap)
map_type: costmap

# Sensor Configuration
# ------------------
# List of sensor sources to process
observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor

# Laser Scanner Configuration
# ------------------------
laser_scan_sensor:
  sensor_frame: cloud_POS_000_DIST1  # Frame ID of the sensor
  data_type: LaserScan               # Type of sensor data
  topic: /scan                       # ROS topic for sensor data
  marking: true                      # Whether to mark obstacles
  clearing: true                     # Whether to clear obstacles
  min_obstacle_height: -0.1          # Minimum height for obstacles
  max_obstacle_height: 2.0           # Maximum height for obstacles

# Transform Configuration
# --------------------
# Maximum time to wait for transforms to be available
transform_tolerance: 1.0

# Additional Safety Parameters
# -------------------------
# Whether to track unknown space
track_unknown_space: false
# Cost at which obstacles are considered lethal (impassable)
lethal_cost_threshold: 100
# Cost assigned to unknown cells
unknown_cost_value: 0
